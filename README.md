# Predict-App-Rating
This project aims to predict the rating of apps on the Google Play Store based on various features and attributes. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model developed in this project can help estimate the rating that an app is likely to receive.

# Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing information about various apps available on the Google Play Store. The dataset includes features such as app category, size, number of installs, reviews, and more. These features serve as input variables for training the prediction model.

# Model Development
The project involves the following steps for model development:

Data Preprocessing: 
The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and any necessary feature engineering.

Feature Selection:
Relevant features are selected to train the prediction model, considering their impact on the app rating.

Model Training:
Various machine learning algorithms are explored and evaluated to find the best model for predicting app ratings. This model works on Random Forest Technique.

Model Evaluation:
The trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess its performance and accuracy in predicting app ratings.
